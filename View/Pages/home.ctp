	Our mission is to bring daily prayer to the consciousness of all individuals and to have prayer going to God in unison at 9am local time.

		see bursts of prayers along an entire longitude of the earth going
		up to our God simultaneously! And with this happening every hour, it would be
		like a "wave" circling the globe. What a wonderful opportunity to give

<p>
Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.<br />
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.<br />
Give us this day our daily bread.<br />
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.<br />
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil:<br />
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
